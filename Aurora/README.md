# Aurora
A lightweight yet mordern PHP framework.

## Why another framework?

Yes, there are alreay numerious frameworks in the php development world. Some of them are quite popular and easy to use, but a framework with following features is still missing:

* Lightweight
* Modern, with full object-oriented design and namespace convention.
* Direct, trying to avoid abstract and encapsulating as much as possible
* Portable, not local filesystem writting permission required
* Clean, easy to master, easy to modify, easy to follow the whole code


CodeIginiter is lightweight, but it is not modern designed (no namespace etc).

Laravel, on the other hand, is designed elegantly and follows all the modern PHP standards, but it is too heavy for small projects. It is usually used as a fullstack framework.

Basically, Aurora trys to combine the advantages of both CodeIginiter and Laravel, creating a framework lightweight and easy to use.
